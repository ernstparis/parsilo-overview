Rough outlines

Collects and displays (field)data. It makes it possible to record data with a tablet device for projects were clients are given services. This data can directly be read out, displayed and downloaded. In other words; it replaces registration of activities on paper by entering this data directly in a tablet device. 
Multiple devices can collect data simultaneously. All the data loads automatically into a central place and can be read out immediately, real life.   
ProTrack is build for monitoring and evaluation purposes for the humanitarian aid sector, but could be used in any setting where ‘service providing’ is recorded.

Set-up
The tool is build for the purpose of registering services, given to clients. Registration of data starts by selecting a client from the list of known clients, through a fast auto-search. If the client is new (and thus not exists in the list), he/she can be instantly created. When the right client is selected, it gives the list of services that are provided in the project. Simply click on the services provided, and register. Each record will equally contain the location and date.
The tool has two platforms. One platform is running on a tablet and collects the data, the other platform (which runs on a computer), gives access to the data and makes it possible to design/modify the tool.

Clients
The user can design the details a clients-profile should contain. Next to the standard-list of Name, Date of birth, Gender and Nationality the user is free to add different details like; - has health-care YES/NO  - has # children  - HIV tested YES/NO  - shoe size - eye-colour - etc., etc.
In addition, the user can design a custom-made questionnaire that can be filled in over time at a defined time-schedule.

Services
A ‘service’ can be anything. The user is free to create them, modify them or delete them at any given time. For example; services can be ‘something given’ to a client (like; a meal, a doctors consult, condoms given, clean syringes, a shower, etc, etc.) but it could equally be ‘something received’ from the client (like; given back used syringes) or something done with the client (tested for diseases, done a training, etc.). They can also contain a quantity like [X] ‘syringes given’.

Offline
The data collection App will run with and without an internet connection. Data is synced automatically when a connection is available.

Reporting
Reporting and graphs give insight on data in real-time. As soon as the data is collected on the device, it is available in the reports. Multiple projects can be combined or separately analyzed.
The data can be consulted through different ways. A standard ‘dashboard’ gives a set of multi-dynamic graphs and tables that can be filtered by different criteria. The data can also be downloaded and used in Excel.


 
History

We developed an IT solution for a small association (Gaia) that provides services in the field to people who use drugs. They keep record of their activities by writing the service they provide down on paper, after which they enter this data in an excel file.

The problem for Gaia was that this takes a lot of time. First it must be written down on paper and later it must be written down again in a excel file. (In 2013 they only entered 25% of their data because of lack of time). The second problem is that writing down on paper and later re-enter this in a computer, allows many mistakes and thus they had the problem of low quality data.

We created a website [March’13-Jan’14] that could be used with a tablet in the field, which made it possible to enter all their data directly into a digital database. This was developed over time where each step was done in direct interaction with the field.

The product (Parsilo) turned out to work very well and increased their quality of data, saved them a lot of time and made it possible for the managers to have a better and immediate view into their activities. Other organisations asked Gaia about the tool and want the same thing.

Next steps?
The development of Parsilo was completely voluntary. Just for fun. The downside of this was always that its survival relied on the goodwill from our side. It was discussed in multiple occasions that in order to increase its sustainability, one of the options was to have it been paid, so somebody could look after it.

This, plus the request of other organisations to have the same tool, was the start of more serious considerations to turn Parsilo into a paid service.

While exploring the possibilities of potentially developing a ‘data-collection tool’, it was logical to explore other possible clients. This is where we found that a very similar tool could be useful to many INGO’s.

We organized a weekend [March’14] to make a decision if we would decide to build a tool that could replace Parsilo and would be useful to a large scale of potential clients with similar problems like gaia.

We discussed rough outlines of what this tool should be and decided to ‘give it a try’.
 
Market context 


There are many ‘mobile data collection tools’ in the market. But they seem to be developed mainly for survey purposes / filling in forms and not adapted to ‘service tracking’. There is a group of people (NOMAD) that are offering the service to find the right tool for organizations that are looking for a mobile data collection tool. (not sure if and how they make money). They offer a list of 35 mobile data collection tools.. I looked into each of them. In blue some that are interesting or need extra looking into it

Acquee is an online mobile data collection platform offering both fully functioning free designer applications with basic hosting as well as hosted solution packages. Acquee enables the design and sharing of forms for the collection and analysis of results, which can be exported in Excel or CSV formats on all major mobile platforms including Windows, Android, Symbian, iOS and Opera Mobile.

CommCare is a mobile application that runs on feature phones or smart phones and can be used to collect data, track people or other entities, and guide responders through procedures or protocols. CommCare applications can incorporate images, audio clips, and videos to enhance communication Some of the key applications of CommCare for humanitarian response include: * Collect, report, and update data from Rapid Assessment forms to be shared across programs and organizations. * Employ image and audio files as a translation tool to help responders communicate key messages in a variety of languages. * Register and establish an ongoing record of displaced people and refugees both in urban and rural settlements. * Provide support for cash-for-work or voucher programs by tracking individuals and their account balances. * Populate a library of clinical protocols for responders to receive step-by-step guidance when needed. * Develop an electronic job aid for use by local volunteers to facilitate minimal training via simple clinical protocols, such as for classifying and treating fever, cough, and diarrhea (e.g. the Community-IMCI protocol).
	Survey purpose.
I think it has a client-based structure were things can be added to a ‘patient/client file’. But is doesn’t seem to be adapted to specific servicetracking
